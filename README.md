JSON-schema
==========

JSON-schema provides a simple interface to load and parse JSON schemas (also defined with JSON†) and then both validate and mock up objects based on parsed schemas.

† *not strictly JSON.  For a variety of reasons the schemas are defined with JavaScript.  Among those are things like JSON requiring quoting of object member names and the inability of JSON to contain functions.  Object mocks can optionally use a function to dynamically generate values.*
